At a global level, each year, HSBC supports educational projects to help young people achieve their potential by giving access to education, providing life-skills and entrepreneurship training, and raising awareness of international and cultural understanding. Through the “Future First” program, HSBC’s education flagship, the company’s objective is to support underprivileged young people and offer them the chance to develop their skills and realize their potential, goals which perfectly fits with Passerelles numériques’ mission and vision.

                            “In July 2015, PN Vietnam happily received the good news! We were very happy to learn that we would get the support from “Future First” program for the IT and soft skills training we deliver to our students.”
                            Ms Karine Colyn, Chief Operating Officer and Chairwoman of Corporate Sustainability at HSBC Vietnam, said as she was visiting PN Vietnam’s center:
                            “Future First is one of the cornerstones of HSBC’s corporate sustainability program and allows us to help some of Vietnam’s most disadvantaged young people gain access to education and develop vital life skills. By linking up with NGOs based in Vietnam such as PNV, we can better align HSBC funds with the needs of the community and sponsor initiatives that are of long-term benefit to young people.”
                            Contributing together to social and economic development
                            Thanks to the generosity and helpful support of its donors and their networks, Passerelles numériques has grown and been able to help more and more underprivileged students in Cambodia, Vietnam and the Philippines, for the last 10 years. Not only the Fundraising team in France, but also local teams in Asia have worked endlessly to search for financial resources, to allow a sustainable development of the organization and its activities.
                            Along with the new strategy built up recently, Passerelles numériques’ objective is to gain local visibility and to develop partnerships with companies based in Asia, in the framework of their CSR policy.
                            Passerelles numériques Vietnam would like to thank HSBC for being on our side and helping us support underprivileged – but nevertheless promising! – young Vietnamese people. We hope to develop more partnerships, opportunities and receive meaningful support, by working closely with our partners and friends.

For the first time, PNV students benefited from LogiGear Certified Test Professional (LCTP), the first in the series the companies’ program developed to enable students and professionals to become certified testing experts.
                            Besides PN Vietnam, LogiGear cooperates with a large number of Universities in Vietnam to make LCTP certification widely available. The program entails two parts: LCTP I reflects techniques and thinking that are applied day-to-day by successful companies that develop software for consumers or provide software development and testing services to other companies; LCTP II focuses on other skills beyond testing techniques to help a new test engineer successfully survive and effectively contribute as a new team member in a test team.
                            A strong and meaningful partnership
                            Over the past 3 years, the partnership between PN Vietnam and LogiGear has been growing. In 2013, while PN Vietnam was restructuring its curriculum, LogiGear generously offered to support our Training team, not only building up the software testing curriculum but also sending a trainer to teach PNV 2014 class and train PN teachers.
                            Mr Truong Vinh Nhu Nguyen, Director of the LogiGear Danang branch, expressed his enthusiasm during PN Vietnam’s 2014 Graduation ceremony:
                                “With their great vision and mission, Passerelles numériques has operated effectively which helps millions of youth with disadvantaged backgrounds to have the opportunity to continue their study, to develop themselves and to change their future… One typical example illustrating the cooperation between PN and LogiGear is that there are many good employees working at our company who used to be PN students.”
                                Back in November 2014, Passerelles numériques Vietnam and LogiGear started to discuss about a closer and stronger cooperation. 6 months later, PN Vietnam was honored to welcome Mr Nguyen Quoc Hung, CEO of LogiGear and representatives of the LogiGear-Danang branch to visit our project and facilities. In September 2015, PN Vietnam was delighted to sign an agreement of cooperation on the LCTP training, in the presence of LogiGear representatives, PN Vietnam staff and students.
                                Mr Nguyen Quoc Hung, CEO of LogiGear, announced during the signing ceremony:
                                “We appreciate the social mission of PN Vietnam and really want to get involved in this meaningful project. In other words, what PN Vietnam has been doing inspired LogiGear and we decided that together, LogiGear and PN Vietnam will bring more job opportunities to these young people.”
                                On November 30, 2015, the first LCTP class took place as planned. Besides the great interest shared by the students from class 2016, PN Vietnam’s training team is curious and excited to observe their growing abilities after this course.
                                Currently, two PN Vietnam alumni are working at LogiGear Danang and two others are joining the testing internship training: another step in this promising partnership!
                                The entire PN team and students warmly thank the LogiGear management board and volunteers who took part in this mission.

Thanks to their reactivity and impressive preparation, the training courses were soon ready and launched last January. Beyond the training aspects, the aim is also to empower our students and help them gain advanced professional and technical skills, while being better prepared to enter the job market. Therefore, courses focused on exploring deeply the IT tools and technologies were studied over the past two years.
                            Two volunteering trainers, Mr Duy Vo and Mr Tuan Pham, showed great devotion and enthusiasm in teaching and interacting with the trainees. “The students really care about their career paths, how to study effectively and what information is important for them to study,” said the trainers. Moreover, our volunteer trainers also have a good synergy with the training team and our training manager, Mr David Caudeli. “PYCO demonstrated a high professionalism, adaptability and reactivity to work with Passerelles numériques. It brought to the team the experience to work with IT professionals. Our teachers have been able to observe and learn from PYCO trainers.” explains David.

                            “Passing the interview run by PYCO Group is an honor for both myself and my family. My family is really proud of me and supports me very much. Thanks a lot to PYCO for giving young underprivileged people the chance to have an internship in an international company.”
                            Our dedicated interns are now giving their best to take advantage of this unique experience!
                            “The students have a pretty good knowledge in algorithm and they successfully put it into practice to complete all their assignments. They’re willing to learn new things and concentrate on learning and researching to solve practical problems that require expansion of knowledge. They also make common mistakes, but I believe that these errors will be overcome through experience. In my opinion, they have the potential to become good Java Software developers” said Mr Duy Vo and Mr Tuan Pham.

                            PNV and PYCO’s collaboration is part of the group’s commitment to support the community in Vietnam. They expressed their enthusiasm to support us by asserting “A digital journey is all about passion” and shared with us their willingness to keep on involving their staff, going one step further with fundraising, computer donation and more IT training courses.

                            What do you think about the training program of PN Vietnam?
                            Passerelles numériques Vietnam has a very effective training program. You propose a very good curriculum that ensures the fundamental knowledge and an obvious career orientation. Beside the technical skills, PN Vietnam also provides a soft skills training that maximizes employment opportunities for students, after graduating. Therefore, they can overcome all the difficulties in their life.
                            The training program delivered by PN Vietnam is also very flexible and makes it adaptable to the fast changing requirements of the labor market.
                            Do you have any comments about PN Vietnam students?
                            I don’t have many chances to interact with them but I acknowledge that they are very polite and dynamic. They also have a very good attitude as they are able to demonstrate their professionalism in their behavior.
                            Do you have any suggestion to improve this partnership?
                            DCT will facilitate the promotion of Passerelles numériques Vietnam’s image and program on our website and other communication channels.
                            In the coming time, we should organize some sharing sessions between teachers and trainers of DCT and PN Vietnam to share about the teaching experiences and discuss how to improve our respective methods for more effectiveness. This is also a chance for teachers and trainers of the two sides to get closer.
                            I hope that PN Vietnam will grow much stronger in the future to support more disadvantaged students.
                            Thank you so much for your time and sharing, Mr. Phan Cao Tho. We wish you all the best and we, at Passerelles numériques Vietnam, also hope that our partnership will grow!

It was not only a great opportunity for students to discover a new environment but also an exciting challenge for them who had never experienced life in a big dynamic city before. With the enthusiastic support from Enfants et Développement (E&D), PNV students were soon ready to start their internship in the city. ',
                'content' => ' E&D is a humanitarian organization whose aim is to help Asian and African children who are victims of war and genocide. E&D has been running family development and vocational training programs in Ho Chi Minh city for over 20 years. With the common aim of supporting families in difficulty, PNV was honored to be working with Ms TRAN Thi Le and Ms. HUYNH Thi Xuan Thao – vocational training social workers at E&D to help six students settle into the homestay where they lived together.
                            Specifically, these two social workers supported the PN Vietnam Education team to follow the students closely, by visiting them weekly and keeping in touch with our educators in Da Nang. Furthermore, Le and Thao were also their guardians in case of emergency or if they needed any help. The idea was to help our students adapt quickly to life in the new city.
                            “For us, as students who live in a remote area of Vietnam, life in Ho Chi Minh city is very chaotic and crowded. We have to make an effort to keep up with the fast pace of the city. Luckily, we had the guidance and encouragement of Ms Le and Ms Thao from the very first moment in Ho Chi Minh.

                                1/ Research and Preparation
                                By tradition, second-year students handle all the tasks of organizing the event by themselves. This year, thanks to the support from Da Nang Business Incubator (DNES) and the author of the book “They will never know”, the 2019 Career Seminar was bigger and held in the amazing venue of DNES.
                                In order to prepare for this event, the students were divided into 6 groups and had to carry out in-depth research into the companies: Competitive advantages, requirements, recruitment mechanism, and so on. Then they set up meetings with the company representatives to get more information and a better understanding of the companies. During the meetings, companies such as Orient Software, MGM technology Partners, Enouvo IT Solutions and Agility IO gave the students some of their reference publications, as well as T-shirts and gifts.Moreover, besides the content, the students were also required to design banners for each company booth and set it up in advance. They put their hearts and enthusiasm into the preparations to ensure the success of the event.
                                2/ Fruitful efforts
                                As expected, the event went very well. Whereas last year’s event target was to clarify essential IT skills and soft skills to improve students’ employability, Career Seminar 2019 shifted the focus to companies’ competitive advantages and demands. As a result, the students were expected to be able to define clearly what to do to meet the needs of their targeted companies.
                                During the event, second-year PN Vietnam students showed their efficiency with detailed, informative, yet lively, presentations on the four companies mentioned above, along with Axon Active and LogiGear. Starting with a general introduction about each company’s history and working environment, the speakers then gradually dug deeper into its working and training system, its technologies as well as benefits and requirements in light of the event’s objectives. After the presentations, came the most exciting part of the day – the Q&A session! The attendees eagerly raised numerous questions, such as the programming languages used or the recruitment criteria in the 6 companies. In this part, students were glad to have the companies’ representatives handle the questions and to provide an “insider’s view“. Additionally, alumni working in the companies also joined the event and shared their experience. This inspired the students and helped them gain more confidence to improve themselves. The Career Seminar created a wonderful opportunity for our students to meet with the companies and thus obtain better visibility of future career options. This could have not have been achieved without the amazing support from our partner companies and sponsors, towards whom PN Vietnam would like to express heartfelt gratitude. ',

As a result, approximately 50% of student study time for IT subjects have been suspended.
                            Knowing that this could happen, PNV has taken precautions to protect the computer equipment from the humidity: we sealed the doors and windows, covered CPUs, monitors, switches before the heavy rains arrived; clean ups are done already twice a year to prevent the dust to stock up in the CPU and oxyding down the circuits. Eventually, the damage to the computers with more than 10 years old is still unavoidable. ',

Whereas We initiated a “Student’s teaching video contest” where each student produced a video in English relating to either a topic on one of their lessons, sport or even yoga. In so doing, students interacted with each other, practiced their English and maintained a sense of cohesion during lockdown. We decided to maintain the internships for our students. We are most grateful to them because internships are a crucial part of our training program.

                'content' => 'The flower grows from storms. Born and raised in Da Nang city, from a young age, Q. was self-conscious of her own situation. Separated parents, Q. lived with her mother, sister, and a half-brother from a young age. The young girl’s family only relies on her mother’s meager salary of just under one million dong per month to live through the day. Q. has had an uneasy childhood with her alcoholic father, and until now Q. has completely lost contact with him. The lack of love from her father was the reason for her inferiority complex. But despite the difficult circumstances, she is always grateful for the love of her mother and her brothers and sisters. The young girl smiled and confided that sometimes she kept comparing with people with better conditions, but then realized how fortunate she was when she met more struggling people around her.
                                Although having a lot of difficulties, Tran T.Q. has always wanted to pursue further education and expand her knowledge. However, the door to the university at that time seemed to have closed when Q. did not get a scholarship and she knew that the tuition for four years of university was much higher than what her family could afford. Q. then learned about PNV – where has helped the strong girl learn many things and have a stable life like today, through a meeting at her high school. With hope and determination, she decided to apply to PNV.
                                Light at the end of the tunnel, Q. shared that fate brought her to PNV. When it seemed that the dream of being a student was blown out, Q. heard Mr. Nguyen – a teacher that later became her teacher at PNV – talk about the organization at the meeting. After going through a rigorous selection process, the young lady officially became a PNV student. PNV has given Q. a chance to sustainably escape poverty through education. She has always felt lucky to be a student of PNV and until now she is always grateful to the teachers who had wholeheartedly taught and cared for her and other students. Not only was she provided with a thorough and quality IT training program, but English skills are also one of the things Q. is proud of after the three-year schooling. From a student feeling inferior to others about her English skills, Q. is now able to confidently communicate with her colleagues at Enouvo IT Solutions – where she works as a developer.
                                Sharing about her changing life, with Tran T.Q., PNV is a place for her to expand her knowledge and improve her skills, which has helped her become an IT engineer. However, the most valuable thing that still makes her choke every time she talks about is the friends who have accompanied her in PNV for three years. During that time, a terrible event happened when her mother, who had always been by Q.’s side, passed away. And it was her close friends who had helped the young girl to overcome the pain and move forward.
                                Talking about Q., Ms. Nguyen Phuong (PNV’s External Relations Officer), who often works side by side with PNV’s students, expressed admiration for this young girl’s fortitude. As Q. affirmed, in life up to now, there are still many things that are not going smoothly and sometimes she feels discouraged, yet “sow a thought, reap an act”, as long as she can be positive and try to self-adjust, she can overcome all the challenges awaiting her in the future.
                                Currently, Tran T.Q. has a better life with a stable and qualified job. Having been through so many storms, the young girl has always been resilient. PNV has given her a chance of life-changing, now it’s time for “the little flower” to keep conquering and developing in her journey of life. ',

                'content' => 'On the occasion of International Women’s Day, PN Vietnam invited three guest speakers who have impressive achievements in their career to come and share their stories in the “Women Talk” event: Ms. Hanh Trang – Co-Founder and General Manager of Enouvo IT Solutions & Enouvo Space, Ms. Thu Nghia – Event Sales Manager of Four Points by Sheraton and Ms. Thuy Trang – General Manager of PN Vietnam. Let’s discover their stories!
                            Women working in Tech industry: Advantages and Disadvantages
                            Ms. Hanh Trang started with the story about her own career path, from a Banking student with an interest in Technology to an IT freelancer, then making her way to become the Co-Founder and General Manager of an IT company after years of hard work. She asserted that “Success doesn’t happen overnight”. It was the result of step-by-step efforts, determination and a great passion for IT.  From her experience, women working in male-dominated jobs like IT often receive more help and support from people. However, there are still certain disadvantages, such as overtime and work pressure. Ms. Trang affirmed that women had to work harder to prove themselves and make continuous improvements in technical knowledge. Getting in the habit of reading technology news every day is a good way to keep up with constantly changing technologies.
                            The importance of goal-setting She recommended 2 methods which the students could adopt to improve their goal-setting skills. The first one is “The Wheel of Life” – a powerful tool to ensure that every aspect of lives are fulfilled in the right way – and the second one is “S.M.A.R.T.” – a method that helps people achieve their goals one step at a time using 5 criteria: Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant and Time-bound. She also had the students try these tools to help them fully understand their usefulness. Goal-setting is an important skill for success, so it is essential to practice it continuously.
                            Valuable advice from successful women The most exciting part was the discussion between the three guest speakers and the students. Lots of questions were raised by the students about other difficulties women may face at work and how to overcome them. Our guest speakers agreed that the greatest challenge, especially for women, is to maintain a work-life balance. There were other questions on how to improve English, common problems that freshers encounter and how to deal with possible contingencies. The discussion ended with the message that in times of hardship, with constant effort and a clear, suitable goal, students could overcome the challenges. This event was a great opportunity for our students to become more aware of the career path in the tech industry and the important skills to prepare for it. There are only a few months left before our 3rd-year students graduate, and we are confident that thanks to this event, they will be well prepared for their future jobs and their new journey in life.

Passerelles numériques Vietnam (PNV) therefore decided to restructure its current library. The project was carefully planned and closely followed by the Educational Team in every step. ',
                'content' => ' The Learning Lounge is not simply a library: beside reading books, it is also a place for students to learn and to entertain together. It is an adapted environment to students and teachers needs, both during and out of class time.
                                After two months of hard work, with the support of the Training team for book suggestions, Admin team for furniture purchase and students for the decoration, the library was finally ready in March 2016.
                                More than a working place…
                                To make it comfortable for students, the room is equipped with tea tables and cushions instead of regular desks. This original outline creates a warm and friendly atmosphere. One wall is decorated by PN Vietnam’s talented students who had previously shown their creativity through classroom decorations. Moreover, the library name was selected among students proposals.
                                “I’m very glad we have a new library. Now I have a quiet and pretty space for reading. I can read more books without spending money,” expressed with joy Xuan Cuong Tran, Class of 2017.

                                The Learning Lounge is not only for students to study individually or in groups, it is also a place where teachers can organise sessions for the English club, Professional Life Training and other educational activities. Besides, the library is a relaxing space with some music instruments (guitar, ukulele, flute), board games and movies. The Education team is planning to arrange some “movie nights” to entertain students after a long day at school. The Learning Lounge is also the perfect place to grab a book. In order to meet all the students’ reading appetite, the Education team tried to collect different types of books and magazines. Thanks to this wide variety, students will find more than only IT books: history, cooking, philosophy, novels, etc.
                                Last but not least, it can be a place for the staff to organise team meetings or socialise with visitors and volunteers.
                                Second-year student Thi Manh Linh Tran shares her feelings: I am very excited to be able to learn, and share precious moments with my friends in a new environment. The Learning Lounge is a place of calm and comfort, and it is perfect for self-studying sessions as well as group learning activities.
                                An amazing support by Société Générale
                                On the 15th of March, PN Vietnam was very honored to welcome Mr. Pascal Lambert, Mr. Gregory Thong and Mr. Paul Birckel, representatives from Société Générale Singapour to attend the opening event.
                                Lise Simonneau, Education and Selection Manager, who led this project from the beginning, expressed her happiness: I am very pleased that the project is finally realized. I am convinced that this place will not only enhance students’ motivation to study and learn new things, but it will also develop their creativity and their well-being at PN Vietnam.

                'content' => ' As part of our holistic educative approach, Passerelles numériques (PN) Vietnam has decided to develop more sports and outdoors activities for this new academic year.
                        Did you know that research has shown that youth who participate in sports benefit intellectually and perform better in their studies?
                        PN is convinced that practicing sports and spending time outdoors contributes widely to a healthy development for our young adults, especially as they spend a large part of their day in front of a computer screen!
                        Moreover, it’s a great way of increasing group cohesion, solidarity among students and strong friendships. Physical activity also helps student to reach emotional balance and build self-confidence.
                        But, to be fair, we could not have done it alone! We had the chance to benefit from Céline’s support, a volunteer and well-experienced Physical Education Teacher full of energy, creativity and always keen on taking up new challenges.
                        “Through sports activities the students can find a very good balance between hard studies, fun and energy! It was challenging to organize sports with no field, no material, and tropical weather (too hot, too much rain, etc.), but we managed to find solutions each time thanks to the students and the Education Team’s motivation! I was impressed by the students’ curiosity and good will. They never give up and always keep smiling. Let’s keep on!” says Céline, 6 months’ volunteer with PNV Education Team.
                        So, with very limited means and material, what can you do?
                        Here are some tips tested and approved by PN Vietnam’s Education Team!
                        Do you remember Flashmobs?
                        They appeared in the early 2000’s and became really popular with the rise of social media. A group of people suddenly gather in a public space, perform an unusual act for a brief time and quickly disperse.
                        Well, it is actually a very fun and useful activity! By dancing, students are both physically active and creative. Organized at the very beginning of the year, it helped a lot to establish good collaboration among students. And guess what? All you need are loudspeakers, a catchy song and a camera to keep a souvenir from this event!
                        Swimming, an essential life skill
                        Danang offers a very long sandy beach with clear water… however, most of our students couldn’t swim and were afraid of the water!
                        An experienced lifeguard and swimming teacher from Australia, Alex, volunteered with us and gave basic swimming lessons to our 2nd year students. They might not be ready for the next Olympics Games, but they surely had a lot of fun!
                        Discover the Ultimate Frisbee!
                        All you need to practice Frisbee is one of these light and popular flying disks and a wide open space! Ultimate Frisbee is cheap and a great way for students to develop their self-governing skills.
                        (Re)-Discover Võ Đạo
                            We also had the amazing opportunity to meet François, a French Master of Vietnamese Martial Art, who volunteered to introduce his art to PN Vietnam’s students. Võ Đạo doesn’t require much equipment but it does demand a strict discipline. One of François’ main challenges was to keep the students interested through fun exercises, while maintaining rigor and respect in the class. He was really keen on sharing the values of Võ Đạo and being with our students was a really interesting experience for him as well.
                            Just dance!
                            A nice pop song, a few steps and you are ready to hit the dance floor! Passerelles numériques Vietnam’s best dancer, Vi, from External Relations Team, was kind enough to share her talents with the students. After many rehearsals, the 88 students knew a choreography and were ready for a real dance battle. Mixing coordination, team building but also creativity and competitive spirit, dancing really is a great activity!
                            Regularity is the key
                            A regular and complete workout does not have to be long nor require special equipment. Céline defined a few basic exercises, easy to practice outdoors, or indoors on a long rainy day. She shared this routine with the Education Team and created technical sheets so that students can practice by themselves.
                    Setting up a regular, consistent and diversified physical training program was not an easy task, especially with our student’s busy schedules, a minimized budget and an unpredictable climate. But our answer to this is: imagination, and a good help from Passerelles numériques’ friends!

                'shortContent' => ' In December 2018, for the first time ever, PN Vietnam successfully organized a pitching contest for the 3rd-year students. This contest is a major highlight in the training program that PN Vietnam has been working on since last year. Let’s see how we did it!',
                'content' => 'The pitching contest is one of the main events of our Entrepreneurship Module, a new course included in our third-year course. During the contest, our 3rd-year students learnt the necessary knowledge and skills to launch a start-up from the first stage of looking for an idea to the last stage of setting up a business model. Some of the courses in the module include Market Research, Product Development, Marketing & Sale, Business Model Canvas. We believe that it is very important to train our students to become not only a successful developer but also an entrepreneur in the IT industry.
                            From the initial 42 ideas proposed by 42 students, 14 ideas were shortlisted, which then went through the weekly approval meeting with the mentors until being completed with a business model and finally join the pitching contest. The audience of over 100 people included not only PN Vietnam’s students but also a number of guests from our partners in IT companies.
                            Finally, 9 excellent ones were selected and implemented in actual IT projects. Some of the ideas were creative and astonishing, such as a website offering service to pick up children after school, an app for selling agricultural products online, and a moto rental app for travellers. This is a great opportunity for students not only to present their creative business ideas but also to apply what they learnt during the 6-week course.
                            The contest came with many challenges and opportunities. Pitching in front of a roomful of IT experts was probably stressful for the students, especially as they had to do the whole presentation in English. In a limited time (less than 10 minutes), the students had to present their business model to the judges and convince them of the potential of their ideas. However, their performances well exceeded our expectations.
                            Some of the guests were really interested in the student’s idea and willing to support the project at the implementation stage. It was also very important that the students received lots of valuable advice and suggestions from the judges and learned how to approve an idea from a professional perspective. Let’s have a look at some of the positive feedback from our partners after the event.
                            In the end, all the teams did a great job and our students learnt a number of valuable lessons and practical skills through the pitching contest as well as during the Entrepreneurship Module. The success of this event is also a great motivation for our Training department to continue following this approach and upgrade the training program to provide quality education to the students as well as matching market demand in the IT sector.',

GML was created nearly 2 years ago by Mr. Phuong Hoang and Mr. Duy Vu. They both graduated from Hanoi University of Science and Technology and Mr. Phuong Hoang continued his master degree in computer science in Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH) in Korea. The workshop was organised on June 27th with 30 PNV Alumni and on June 30th with more than 80 PNV students.
                            EduSi application
                            They experienced the very new Learning by Experimenting through EduSi (Education Simulation) application where users can create their own virtual experiments, scenarios or illustrations in physics, biology, chemistry, etc. In addition, users can create their own games or puzzles thanks to the app. Using the app, teachers can also make their presentations in class more intuitive and more interactive. In addition, they are able to share their ideas or animations to millions of users around the world.
                            One of our alumni, Vo Ma Dien, who organised the workshop for the alumni, is very interested with EduSi application. He said ”this application is very helpful and ideally-suited to teaching IT to students in Vietnam. GML’s works and contribution in education inspired young developer community to create more meaning for the community.”
                            ”For me, this technology is quite new even though I have 2-year working experience as a developer. So, I would really like to be more active in approaching new technologies and taking part in these kinds of workshops. PNV Alumni network should take the lead in organising this kind of workshop for local the IT community. It will also be a great way to reinforce the PNV alumni community”.
                            Mid-air Force Feedback Interface
                            In the workshop, students and alumni also experienced computer simulation: Mid-air force feedback interface allows users to touch and interact with virtual floating objects.
                            Let’s hear some from Phuong Hoang – founder of GML about his impression of PNV students during his workshop: ”It was a great pleasure to meet PNV students and alumni. They are both curious about new technologies and raise a lot of questions regarding computer simulation topic. I can see maturity of PNV alumni in the way they organised the workshop, which was a success.”
                            There will be more workshops and activities bringing new technologies to our students and inspiring their passion in technology in the near future.

                                They participated in two internships during their second and third academic years and received positive feedback from the companies. Most of them were even offered confirmed positions in the companies before officially graduating.',

                            “I found my ideal job at AgilityIO Vietnam as a Front end developer in September 2016, just after graduating! I am currently working with senior staff, using the SCRUM methodology. Every morning, we sit together for about 15 to 45 minutes to share our results, our difficulties, as well as our daily plan. I start with my assigned tasks and by the end of the day, I summarize and email the report of the daily achievements to each team members. The working environment at AgilityIO Vietnam is very professional and pleasant.
                            I work hard to get the best results possible and I always make sure I am available to support my colleagues. It’s not easy! To deliver a good performance, I need to combine many things such as daily work planning, communication with colleagues and problem solving. But, the more I learned, the better I am at what I do. I really enjoy my new working life!
                            I haven’t planned to continue my studies as my priority is my career path for now. I focus on improving my skills through self-learning and with the help of my company. However, I will probably soon go on an English course.
                            I always try to keep time for my hobbies such as reading, joining charity activities and going out with my family. These moments help me to socialize and renew my energy for another working day.
                            My family is very happy. They never thought that I could continue to study and have such a good job. I am very happy as well because now, I can take care of myself and support my relatives. I am currently paying for my sister’s studies at Danang University. My family is a great source of motivation for me to work hard and have a better life. I know they would like to express their deepest gratitude to Passerelles numériques Vietnam who played an important role in creating this wonderful life we have now!”
